(a)
Output if DEBUG is defined:
Value of i: 1
Value of j: 2
Value of k: 3
Value of i + j: 3
Value of 2 * i + j - k: 1
(b)
Output if DEBUG is not defined.
(c) If DEBUG macro isn't defined preprocessor uses definition of PRINT_DEBUG(n) that doesn't contain replacement list with printf function.
(d) It is necessary for the DEBUG macro to be defined before debug.h is included because this macro is used in debug.h.
